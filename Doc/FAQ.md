## Application Related Questions

### How To Determine Whether a Project Has Been Work on at Present?

If you come across a “proposal pending” tag, check if the proposal is still in its early stages. In such cases, you may want to submit your own proposal to compete.
Conversely, if a proposal has already undergone an interview or evaluation process, the competition window may have closed.

### Does This Deadline of a Round Affect the Completion of Open Tasks?

This means you can submit proposals up to this date. However, the timeframe to compete with other proposals may not extend for the full three months. The evaluation process will begin once there are no further proposals submitted within a certain timeframe. It's important to note that your work on the tasks may continue beyond the end of the round, depending on the specific details of the task.

### How Many Proposals Are Going to be Accepted per "Task"?

Generally one proposal will be accepted. However,
1. you can compete with other proposals during the proposal stage.
2. or you can simply work on other tasks
3. or all the applicants can form a team

### What is the Selection Criteria as Applicants?

Our selection criteria are tailored for young university students, active technical community members, and early-career professionals in cryptography and blockchain, focusing on those with a strong interest in advancing their knowledge and contributions in the field.

### Can I Apply for Multiple Tasks at the Same Time?

No, simultaneous applications for multiple tasks are not permitted. You are only eligible to apply for a new task once you have reached the final stage of your current task. This ensures focused and dedicated efforts towards completing each task effectively.

### Can I Work on My Proposal Before the Grant Agreement is Signed?

Our legal team advises that grantees should not begin work on their grants until they have countersigned the grant agreement. This requirement may affect the acceleration program's timeline. Grantees must wait for the entire process to be completed before commencing their work. If the original starting and due dates become outdated due to this delay, grantees can communicate with their assigned evaluator to establish new, mutually agreeable dates.

### What if my proposal is submitted close to the deadline?
If your proposal is submitted very close to the deadline, it will automatically be considered in the next round of evaluations. You are welcome to continue refining and improving your proposal during this time.

## Pricing Rate and Budget Related Questions

### What is the Purpose of the Grants Issued as Part of the Program?

The acceleration program is primarily an educational initiative aimed at "accelerating" practitioners by giving them challenges designed to help them learn and improve. The grants issued as part of the program should not be the primary reason to tackle issues and challenges.

### How to Decide the Budget Given the Complexity(medium) of the Project?

There’s a predetermined pricing rate based on the complexity. There will be more info in a call between applicants and the PSE team after content wise evaluation.

### Why is the Payment Rate the Same for All Participants?

We follow EF PeopleOp's grant amount guideline suggestion that we should not change the amount of payment based on the country in which the person lives except in extreme cases, We set at this pricing rate for that the purpose of the acceleration program is not purely for the contribution but most importantly for learning purpose. This rate is consistent with the target audience framework listed in program repo.

### Program Related Questions

## Who Funds Acceleration Program?

These open tasks are funded by Privacy Scaling Explorations. 

## What's the Difference Between the Acceleration Program and the Other Grants?

The acceleration program typically offers smaller grants and is aimed at beginners who possess the skills to undertake cryptocurrency-related projects. For example, applicants should be familiar with zero-knowledge Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) or have an understanding of cryptography. Our goal is to help these individuals like students or early stage cryptography learner to advance by working on real-world project ideas.
In contrast, other grant programs like ESP often require applicants to propose their own ideas, and the grant amounts can vary considerably.
