# Grant Liaison Guide

## How to Get Started

1. Submit your idea as an issue
2. Follow the template
3. Wait for matching with applicant
4. Review the proposal
5. Review milestone until completion

## Purpose

The purpose of this acceleration program is to help enable the potential of
those who recently started their journey in the world of ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc.
Specifically, our goal is to:

1. **Lower the entry barrier for ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc research**

    For many people, it is not clear how to get started with ZKP research, and
    we want this program to be a menu of options for those interested in going
    deeper. We aim for this program to encourage people in the community to
    take on the challenge of attaining a deeper understanding of ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc.

2. **Encourage domain expertise development**

    Many people go through a ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc-focused course or program (e.g.
    zkPlayground or PSE Summer Contribution Program) and may not have the
    resources to continue their learning in a specific direction after the
    program ends.

    With this program, we would like to support them to continue building
    deeper knowledge and skills into more specific areas of research and
    eventually become a domain expert.

## Application Life Cycle

![lifecycle.png](../Image/lifecycle.jpeg)

The diagram above illustrates the general life cycle of a program application
from the formation of an idea as an Open Task RFP all the way to the execution
of an initial milestone. Some of these details are clarified further here:

1. **Idea Sourcing and Open Task RFP**
    1. PSE research team member can add their ideas as issue
    2. Acceleration program coordinator will collect them to [Open Task List RFP](./Open-Task-RFP-List.md)
2. **Applicant Selection**
    1. Applicants will be solicited to evaluate the list of available Open Task
    RFP and submit their proposal along with relevant milestones as an issue.
    2. In the case where multiple applicants are interested in the same Open
    Task RFP, we shall consider one of the following options:
        1. Evaluate them at the same time (i.e. round-style with a deadline for submission).
        2. Evaluate them on a first-come first-serve basis.
        3. Other. We might have to consider these proposals on a case-by-case basis.
            1. If all the applicants meet the criteria, we might consider grant
            multiple applicants.
3. **Grant Liaison Matching**
    1. Internally we maintain a grant liaison availability list and their
    domain expertise alongside their names. EcoDev will work with leadership
    and project leads to determine the appropriate candidate to be an evaluator.
4. **Milestone Completion and Funding**
    1. Grantee will receive a small amount of funding after the completion of
    the first milestone.
    2. Following milestones will be awarded larger amounts.
    3. Stale issues will be closed by grant liaison or a bot.

## Operational Platform

For the operation of this program, we will primarily utilize a Github repository
for managing documents and staging of the grant proposals, grantees, and their
progress. Stakeholders involved can utilize Github issues and pull requests to
comment and collaborate.
