## Program Overview

Acceleration program is to help enable the potential of those who recently
started their journey in the world of ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc. Specifically, our goal
is to:

1. Lower the entry barrier for ZKP/FHE/lookup/etc research
2. Encourage domain expertise development

Project ideas are submitted as Open Task RFP into a Github repository by PSE
Research Team. Potential applicant will then submit proposals to be evaluated
by “Grant Liaisons”. A grant liaison will not only be evaluating the initial
proposal, but will also be supervising milestone completion, approving
disbursement of funds, ongoing tracking/advising and general oversight of
an awarded grant.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This program target developers and zk-researchers both at beginner to intermediate level. For applicants not in these categories, please consider applying for the [Ethereum Support Program Grant](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/)
