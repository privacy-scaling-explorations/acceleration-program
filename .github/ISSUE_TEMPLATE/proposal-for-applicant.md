## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 2 weeks = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Total Estimated Working Hours:** XXX hr
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) 
* Expected Start Date: FILL IN DATE
* Expected End Date: FILL IN DATE

### Milestone 1 Example Application V1
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1

#### Deliverables and Specifications

##### 0b. Documentation

We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up the application. Application is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. 

##### 0c. Testing Guide

The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests.

##### 1. Functionality: X

We will write a piece of code that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) 

##### 2. Functionality: Y
